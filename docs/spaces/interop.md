vlpds tracks the reference implementation, since the proposal leaves a lot of the wire to it.
Where the spec is silent, vlpds matches the reference's behaviour. Where vlpds differs, it's on
purpose, and `tests/REFERENCE_COVERAGE.md` lists each case.

## The pin

The pin is bluesky-social/atproto PR #5187 (branch `permissioned-data`) at `16bfeba7`, the
November 13 alpha (`0.0.0-spaces-alpha-20261113224550` on npm), with bluesky-social/proposals 0016
at `2755e73a`. The lexicons are vendored unmodified in `lexicons/spaces-alpha` and the test vectors
in `testdata/spaces-alpha`, both generated from that commit by running the reference.

## What this alpha changed, and where it lands

The Stored data column says what happens to rows the previous release wrote. Every new family is
one the previous release never reads, so rolling back leaves it in place, unread.

| Upstream | vlpds | Breaking | Stored data |
|---|---|---|---|
| `getSpaceCredential` becomes `authorizeSpaceSync`: `credentialKey` (the did:key) for `credentialKid`, an optional `notify` `{endpoint, token}`, and the space's `spaceRev` in the output | `xrpc/space.rs` | yes | none |
| Registrations are webhooks: `registerNotify` and `unregisterNotify` are gone. A `notify` is confirmed once (`confirmRegistration` echoes a challenge), renewed by each authorization that carries it, and lapses at the credential's `exp`. A refused authorization withdraws the registration it carries (proposals #138, #140) | `xrpc/space.rs`, `space/host.rs` | yes | new `sG` rows. The previous release's `sN` registrations name a service DID, with no endpoint or token, so they can't become registrations: they stay inert, nothing is sent to them, and they're dropped once expired (24 h at most) at the space's next fan-out, or with the space |
| The host tells syncers with `notifySpaceUpdate`: the token in the body and no service auth, the update a `repoWrite`, `repoRemoved`, `spaceDeleted` or `registrationExpired` (#140) | `space/fanout.rs`, `space/host.rs` | yes | none |
| `notifySpaceDeleted` is gone. `spaceDeleted` goes to every registration, lapsed ones included. A lapsed registration gets one `registrationExpired` notice in place of its next update, then nothing; one that refuses it, or whose notice stops being retried, is dropped unless it was renewed. Failed notices are retried after 1 m, 10 m, 1 h, 6 h, then every 12 h, with 50–100% jitter, for 72 h, and a deletion notice replaces a pending expiry notice, never the reverse (#138, #140) | `space/notices.rs` | yes | new `sE` rows for notices that failed. The previous release's pending `notifySpaceDeleted` retries (`sD`) are for a method that's gone and a registration that can't carry over: they're dropped unsent at their expiry |
| `notifyWrite` becomes `notifyRepoUpdate` (repo host to authority, service auth with that `lxm`) (#137) | `xrpc/space.rs`, `worker.rs` | yes | the `sP` outbox rows carry over: a notify the previous release still owed goes out under the new name |
| `listRepos` becomes `listWriters`, a union: `repoWrite` `{repo, repoRev, data, spaceRev}` or `repoRemoved` `{repo, spaceRev}`. A writer taken out of the set stays listed as removed, and the removal is sequenced and sent to syncers (`removeWriter`, `removeMembers`, a `putMembers` without write) (#144) | `space/repo.rs`, `xrpc/space.rs` | yes | new `sX` rows for removed writers. A writer the previous release removed has no row, so it isn't listed as removed |
| MACs are RFC 9421 signatures. `Accept-Signature: mac=("atproto-space-commit";sf);keyid="<key share>";tag="atproto-space-commit"` asks for one, and the response carries an `Atproto-Space-Commit` (or `Atproto-Space-Record`) header with an `hmac-sha256` `Signature` over it under the requested label. `listRepoOps` carries the commit and its MAC on every page (#141) | `space/mac.rs`, `space/sfv.rs`, the four read handlers | yes | none |
| The MAC key is an HPKE export (DHKEM(P-256), HKDF-SHA256, export-only AEAD, info `atproto-mac`) to the author's `#atproto_kem` key (#142) | `space/mac.rs` | yes | none: the KEM keys are unchanged |
| A credential request's signature is the one tagged `atproto-space-credential`, under any label, and there must be exactly one; clients sign as `sig` (#141) | `space/httpsig.rs` | yes | none |
| `putMember` and `removeMember` become `putMembers` and `removeMembers`: up to 100 DIDs, one commit, the last entry for a repeated DID wins, a non-member is ignored | `xrpc/space_policy.rs` | yes | none: members are stored as before |
| `managedspace`: `checkUserAccess` becomes `checkAccess` `{space, repo?, clientId?}` answering `{read, write}`. The app is asked even without a delegation token (no `repo`), and one that can't answer is `UpstreamFailure` (502) (#130, #139) | `space/host.rs`, `xrpc/space_policy.rs` | yes | none |
| A `memberspace` member with write off stays out of the writer set under `publicWrite` (#139) | `space/repo.rs` | no | none: it applies from that member's next write |
| Renames: `createSpace` and `getSpace` return `space`; `removeWriter` takes `repo`; `listSpaces` takes `spaceDid` and `spaceType` and lists `{space, repoRev?, data?, spaceRev?}`; `notifyCredentialRevoked` is `notifyCredentialsRevoked`; errors `NotSpaceOwner` → `NotAuthorized`, `BadSpaceMac` → `InvalidSpaceMac`, and new `InvalidCursor`, `InvalidRepoFile`, `RepoMismatch` (`importRepo`) and `InvalidSpaceMeta` (#137) | the space methods | yes | none |
| Space repos and meta archives are `application/vnd.dasl.star`; a meta archive's writer values are `{repoRev, data, spaceRev}` (#137) | `space/star.rs`, `space/meta.rs` | yes | none stored. An archive exported by the previous release (`rev`) doesn't import: export it again |
| `listRecords` loses `reverse` (newest URI first, always) and `listBlobs` loses `since`; `listRepoOps` of a repo with no head is `RepoNotFound` (#137) | `xrpc/space.rs` | yes | none |

Where the spec is silent and vlpds copies the reference: `updateSpace` leaves the writer set as it is
(only `removeWriter`, `removeMembers` and a `putMembers` without write take a writer out),
`listRepoOps` leaves out values for superseded ops, `listSpaces` treats its filters as the scope
target, so an unfiltered listing needs a wildcard grant, and an export of space meta leaves removed
writers out. Where this alpha was loose and vlpds follows the reference:

- A MAC request for the other profile's tag counts as no request, so the credential read gets
  `InvalidSpaceMac`.
- `notifyRepoUpdate` with the bare authority DID as `aud` is accepted, as `<authority>#atproto_pds` is.
- A refused authorization is refused even when its `notify` couldn't be confirmed: the policy's
  `SpaceNotFound` comes first, and no confirmation is sent.
- A `managedspace` app that says no to an authorization without a delegation token gets
  `SpaceNotFound`, as a refused member does.

## Where vlpds differs

| | Reference PDS | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | legacy app passwords and password sessions can read and write the account's own space records | OAuth only (final). App passwords (scoped or not) and password sessions get no space reads, writes or delegation tokens, `getServiceAuth` tokens for space methods go only to OAuth apps whose `space:` grant covers the action (the reference checks only `rpc:`), and `importRepo` is OAuth too |
| Admin token on space reads | accepted on the space read methods, a taken-down repo's included | not accepted. Operators read through the audited `vlpds.admin` space methods ([Operating](operating.md)) |
| Exports by a taken-down account | its `allowTakendown` password session may export its spaces | none: space data is OAuth-only, and OAuth signs no taken-down account in |
| Fan-out to syncers | each update goes out as it's sequenced, unordered | one lane per (space, registration), in spaceRev order, a writer's waiting update replaced by its newer one |
| notifyRepoUpdate delivery | a retry row written only after a send fails, so an acked write's notify can be lost in a crash | the `sP` row is in the write's own log entry |
| Delegation tokens and client attestations | any lifetime (it mints 60 s) | refused past 300 s, since their `jti`s are held until `exp` |
| Request signatures | no size cap, and header values decoded as latin1 | `Signature-Input` and `Signature` over 8 KiB refused, and header values must be visible ASCII |
| did:keys | refuses hybrid (0x06/0x07) points | the same, checked explicitly, since libsecp256k1 alone would parse them |
| Token claims | `iss` and `sub` need only be truthy | they must be non-empty strings |
| Credential keys | resolves the authority's key on every request | caches a verified credential until `exp`, so a key rotation shows up within the hour |
| Account takedown | the app's session works again after a reversal (what the harness expects) | revokes the account's OAuth sessions, and they stay revoked after a reversal. The app has to sign in again |
| Credentials for taken-down members | issued | refused |
| Record takedown | none for space records: `updateSubjectStatus` refuses a space record | hidden from every space read, and every commit and MAC is over the set without it (a vlpds extension, see [Takedowns](privacy.md#takedowns)) |
| Space takedown | none | a vlpds extension: no credentials, no `listWriters` or registrations, notifies dropped |
| Registrations | no cap | 256 per space and 1,024 per authority, lapsed ones counted. A new one past a cap takes the place of the space's longest-lapsed registration, and is refused if none has lapsed. New registrations are rate-limited per space |
| Registration confirmation | waits on the endpoint for as long as it takes | one `confirmRegistration` per new registration, with the outbound HTTP client's timeout, and only to an `https` URL (`http` too in dev mode) with no credentials in it |
| Oplog | keeps every op | keeps 7 days. A `since` past that gets the window's start, and the syncer falls back to `getRepo` |
| Revocations | stored for any audience the host has, unbounded, one row each | stored only when the audience account holds a repo in the space or its authority is here (else 200, dropped), capped per authority, space and account, and one past a cap blocks the space's credentials ([Revocation](reading.md#revocation)) |
| Space repo size | no cap | 100k records (`--space-repo-max-records`) |
| Space record size | 1 MiB | 1,000,000 bytes on a write, as for public records; an import takes up to STAR's 1 MiB |
| importRepo | no notify | the authority is told of the imported repo's new rev, as after any write |
| Backlinks | a like of a space URI is recorded as a backlink | public URIs only |
| `sync.getBlob` with Spaces on | serves only publicly referenced blobs | the same. Without `--spaces`, vlpds still serves an upload before any record names it |
| Writes during `clearRecords` or `importRepo` | wait for its transaction | refused with `InvalidRequest` (retry) while the clear or import holds the repo |
| `managingApp` | must start with `did:` | the part before `#` must be a valid DID |

## Upstream gaps

```steps
- title: HTTP signatures cover two headers
  body: "A request signature covers only `authorization` and `atproto-space-audience`, with no method or URL. So a captured request can be replayed against any read of the same repo while its credential lives. vlpds requires the audience to be a DID and the target repo, checks the credential's space against the request, and checks revocation on every request. The MAC adds nothing here: it authenticates the response to the syncer, not the request to the host."
- title: Takedowns and the LtHash (Q11)
  body: "The spec has no record takedown for space data, and a hidden record still counts in the repo's hash. vlpds serves a takedown-adjusted view: every read MACs a commit over the set without the hidden records. It keeps every view verifiable, so upstream could adopt it as is."
- title: KEM keys need a PLC operation
  body: "A syncer can't read an account's repos until its `#atproto_kem` key is in its DID document. For an account whose rotation key vlpds doesn't hold (a did:web, or a did:plc that removed it), the key is stored and the owner has to publish it, and until then credential reads of its repos fail."
```
